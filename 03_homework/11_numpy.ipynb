The formula for exponential growth is `population_size = N0 *e**rt`, where `N0` is the initial population, `e` is the exponential function, `r` is the rate, and `t` is time. Using this:\n","\n","1.   Set the initial population, `N0`, as 100 and the growth rate, `r`, as 0.4\n","2.   Use the suitable `numpy` function to generate an array of time points, `t`, which go from 0 to 10 seconds, in 0.2 second increments.\n","3.   Write an expression to evaluate `population_size`, which should be an array of the population size for each time point in `t`.\n","4.   Create a new variable called `population_size_noise`, use the same expression you wrote in parts (3), and add noise to the population at each time point. Do this by adding an expression that uses a `numpy` function to generate a random value for each time point drawn from a normal distribution of `mean=0` and `stdev=250` (i.e., population_size_noise = expression_from_part_a + expression_to_add_noise)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"ok","timestamp":1668296875008,"user":{"displayName":"Kaylie Lau","userId":"01284785813595846851"},"user_tz":300},"id":"ULSswoS4EhRs","outputId":"6d541d46-0b4f-4300-9d52-bfd6d4877aff"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Population size is:  [ 100.          108.32870677  117.3510871   127.12491503  137.71277643\n","  149.18246976  161.60744022  175.06725003  189.64808793  205.44332106\n","  222.55409285  241.08997064  261.16964734  282.92170144  306.48542033\n","  332.01169227  359.66397256  389.61933018  422.0695817   457.22251951\n","  495.30324244  536.55559711  581.24373944  629.6538261   682.09584693\n","  738.90560989  800.44689143  867.11376585  939.33312874 1017.56743061\n"," 1102.31763806 1194.12644178 1293.58173155 1401.32036077 1518.0322245\n"," 1644.46467711 1781.42731796 1929.79717555 2090.52432351 2264.63796432\n"," 2453.25301971 2657.57726999 2878.91908792 3118.69581683 3378.44284638\n"," 3659.82344437 3964.63940726 4294.84259788 4652.54744398 5040.04447781\n"," 5459.81500331]\n","Population size with noise is:  [ 658.02465567   71.49744806  325.07568635 -117.33349153  162.07785505\n","  324.07783024  363.82082115 -262.53938499 -333.24102161    5.49048129\n","  324.95742708 -348.26203241   -6.47875373   10.83327031  217.82084809\n","   27.37379209  925.79140908  536.73917067   71.82452254 -145.17061483\n","  343.07489533  384.51701647  586.75099392  341.62825454  588.50349669\n","  667.92996409  145.84929391  914.55000745 1294.17195098 1256.29672764\n"," 1171.72671218 1203.10534038 1498.01857628 1482.46740252 1297.14820216\n"," 1526.99074083 1977.45414029 1739.41814723 1767.10735404 2547.70344017\n"," 2240.10665681 2995.23802232 2847.30490791 3052.74801588 3011.92040534\n"," 3502.5779828  3842.20238904 4150.91421317 4798.72519604 5276.56015773\n"," 5397.69798711]\n"]}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","N0 = 100\n","\n","rate = 0.4\n","\n","t = np.arange(start=0, stop=10.2, step=0.2)\n","\n","\n","population_size = N0 * np.exp(rate*t)\n","print('Population size is: ',population_size)\n","\n","\n","population_size_noise = N0 * np.exp(rate*t) + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=250, size=np.shape(population_size))\n","print('Population size with noise is: ',population_size_noise)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<details>\n","  <summary>Answer</summary>\n","\n","  ```python\n","  import numpy as np\n","\n","  #set initial population\n","  N0 = 100\n","  #set growth rate\n","  rate = 0.4\n","  #create array of time points \n","  t = np.arange(start=0, stop=10.2, step=0.2)\n","\n","  #calculate population of colony at the time points in t\n","  population_size = N0 * np.exp(rate*t)\n","  print('Population size is: ',population_size)\n","\n","  #add noise to population at each time point\n","  population_size_noise = N0 * np.exp(rate*t) + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=250, size=np.shape(population_size))\n","  print('Population size with noise is: ',population_size_noise)\n","  ```\n","</details>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QmxvYhS3OCNJ"},"source":["### 2.
